// Better Auth is mounted in this app's own server (`server/auth.config.ts`), so every request is
// same-origin: no explicit `baseURL` or credentialed CORS is needed.
//
// Both plugins are passed exactly as their factories return them. Better Auth infers the whole
// client API from this list in one pass, reading each plugin's `$InferServerPlugin`, so widening
// one entry — by intersecting it with the base `BetterAuthClientPlugin` interface, for instance —
// costs the *other* plugin its inferred endpoints: `organization.list`, `organization.inviteMember`
// and the rest stop existing on the client's type.
//
// Declared as a factory rather than a plain object so `useAppConfig()` is callable: the module
// builds the client lazily, inside the Nuxt app, so the policy published at build time is readable
// by the time this runs.

    // between the accounts this browser holds sessions for, `deviceAuthorizationClient` is what the
    // `/device` page calls to approve or deny a CLI's request, and `dashClient` reads the hosted
    // audit log.
